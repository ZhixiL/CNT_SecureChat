# CNT_SecureChat

The current topic that we have agreed on is a secure group chat software/program. For the programming language, we will most likely be using Java or Python. To ensure the secure aspect of our project, weâ€™re planning to use an encryption algorithm, which we have two possible directions:

The approach KDC, where we'll establish a central server for a secure shared key distribution, allowing the users of our secure group chat to establish a secure channel with the session key generated by the central server. 

We will also have an interface that allows users to log in with a username and password which we will hash and manage within a database. Potentially, we may add features such as 2 - Factor Authentication or the ability to send photos if time permits.

We will be using:
Flask
SQLite
Python
